# hello-convert

This is my first CLI tool written in GoLang. It's a simple utility that will output the phrase 'Hello' in most languages.

## Screenshots
The '-lang=[language]' flag is used to output a greeting in the given language
```
$ hello-convert -lang=jap
こんにちは
```
The 'list' subcommand will display all available languages (screenshot condensed)
```
$ hello-convert list
Chinese
Spanish
English
Hindi
Bengali
Portugese
Russian
Japanese
...
```
